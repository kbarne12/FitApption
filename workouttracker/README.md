# FitApption

#### Keep Track of your fitness journey with FitApption!

*FitApption* was created during the fourth unit of [General Assembly](https://www.generalassemb.ly)'s Software Engineering Immersive program. The initial version was planned, developed and deployed over the course of one week.

## Description
*FitApption* was developed to track the fitness progress of it's users. It's tough to remember how many times you've worked outor how many calories you've eaten in a given week. FitApption tracks the number of workouts you've completed, the calories you consume and a visible image of your physical progres.

### Getting Started:
The app can be launched [here](https://fitapption.herokuapp.com/) and was deployed using Heroku.

I used Trello to oranize this project throughout development. The Trello board can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/sq9Ba1mL/unit-4-wireframe).
